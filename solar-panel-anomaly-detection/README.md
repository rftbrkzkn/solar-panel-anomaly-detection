# Anomaly Detection in Photovoltaic Panels using YOLOv8m

This repository contains the implementation of a deep learning-based thermal anomaly detection framework for photovoltaic (PV) panels. Leveraging the YOLOv8m architecture, the model detects **hotspots** in infrared (IR) thermographic images of PV modules.
